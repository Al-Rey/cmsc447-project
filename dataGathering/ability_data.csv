If this Pokémon is confused, its confusion is not checked when loafing around; the Pokémon cannot hurt itself, and its confusion does not end or come closer to ending.

If this Pokémon attempts to move but fails, e.g. because of paralysis or gravity, it still counts as having moved and will loaf around the next turn.  If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is asleep or frozen, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did.

Electric-type move."

any held items."
103,mold-breaker,4,"This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.

For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat.  If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.

Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.

An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.

Moves that inflict typeless damage, such as future sight, and moves of variable type, such as hidden power, count as their listed types.  counter, metal burst, mirror coat, and one-hit KO moves to which this Pokémon is immune do not trigger this ability.","Senses the foe’s
dangerous moves."
107,forewarn,4,"When this Pokémon enters battle, it reveals the move with the highest base power known by any opposing Pokémon to all participating trainers.

become critical hits."
290,magic-guard,4,"This Pokémon is immune to damage not directly caused by a move.

For example, this Pokémon takes no damage from from weather, recoil, status ailments, or spikes, but it still suffers from the Attack cut when burned, and a life orb will still power up this Pokémon's moves without damaging it.  Anything that directly depends on such damage will also not happen; for example, leech seed will neither hurt this Pokémon nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon with a jaboca berry or rowap berry will not consume the berry when hit by this Pokémon.

The following are unaffected: struggle, pain split (whether used by or against this Pokémon), belly drum, substitute, curse, moves that knock the user out, and damage from confusion.

This Pokémon will neither lose nor regain HP if it drains HP from a Pokémon with liquid ooze.

If this Pokémon is badly poisoned, the poison counter is still increased each turn; if the Pokémon loses this ability, it will begin taking as much damage as it would be if it had been taking increasing damage each turn.","The Pokémon only takes
damage from attacks."
291,no-guard,4,"Moves used by or against this Pokémon never miss.

One-hit KO moves are unaffected.  Moves affected by this ability can hit Pokémon during the preparation turn of moves like dig or fly.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is doubled.","Ensures the Pokémon and
its foe’s attacks land."
292,stall,4,"This Pokémon moves last within its priority bracket.

Multiple Pokémon with this ability move in order of Speed amongst themselves.

The full incense and lagging tail take precedence over this ability; that is, Pokémon with these items move after Pokémon with this ability.  Pokémon with both this ability and one of these items are delayed as much as if they had only the item.

This ability works as usual during trick room: Pokémon with this ability will move in reverse order of Speed after Pokémon without it.","The Pokémon moves after
even slower foes."
293,technician,4,"This Pokémon's moves have 1.5× their power if their base power is 60 or less.

This includes moves of variable power, such as hidden power and magnitude, when their power is 60 or less.  helping hand's power boost is taken into account for any move, as is defense curl's power boost for rollout.","Powers up the Pokémon’s
weaker moves."
294,leaf-guard,4,"This Pokémon cannot be given a major status ailment during strong sunlight.

This ability does not heal prior status ailments.  rest will fail altogether with this ability in effect.  yawn will immediately fail if used on this Pokémon during strong sunlight, and an already-used Yawn will fail if the weather turns to strong sunlight in the meantime.","Prevents status problems
in sunny weather."
295,klutz,4,"In battle, this Pokémon cannot use its held item, nor will the item have any passive effect on the battle, positive or negative.  This Pokémon also cannot use fling.

The Speed cut from the iron ball and the effort items (the macho brace, power weight, power bracer, power belt, power lens, power band, and power anklet) is unaffected.  Items that do not directly affect the battle, such as the exp share, the amulet coin, or the soothe bell, work as usual.  All held items work as usual out of battle.

Other moves that use the held item, such as natural gift and switcheroo, work as usual.","The Pokémon can’t use
any held items."
296,mold-breaker,4,"This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.

For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat.  If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.

Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.

An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.

When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.

The move itself is not revealed; only that there is such a move.  Moves that inflict typeless damage, such as future sight, and moves of variable type, such as hidden power, count as their listed types.  counter, metal burst, mirror coat, and one-hit KO moves to which this Pokémon is immune do not trigger this ability.","Senses the foe’s
dangerous moves."
300,forewarn,4,"When this Pokémon enters battle, it reveals the move with the highest base power known by any opposing Pokémon to all participating trainers.

In the event of a tie, one is chosen at random.

Moves without a listed base power are assigned one as follows:

This ability functions identically to solid rock.","Powers down super­
effective moves."
304,slow-start,4,"This Pokémon's Attack and Speed are halved for five turns upon entering battle.

This ability also takes effect when acquired during battle.  If this Pokémon loses its ability before the five turns are up, its Attack and Speed return to normal; if it then regains this ability without leaving battle, its Attack and Speed are halved again, but the counter keeps counting from where it was.","Temporarily halves Attack

Ghost Pokémon's other types affect damage as usual.","Enables moves to hit
Ghost-type foes."
306,storm-drain,4,"All other Pokémon's single-target water-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon, if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon's Water moves raise this Pokémon's Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.

If the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.

309,snow-warning,4,"The weather changes to hail when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless cancelled by another weather condition.

If multiple Pokémon with this ability, drizzle, drought, or sand stream are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of Speed, respecting trick room.  Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.","The Pokémon summons a
hailstorm in battle."
310,honey-gather,4,"This Pokémon has a chance of picking up honey after each battle.  This chance starts at 5% and rises another 5% after every tenth level: 5% from level 1–10, 10% from 11–20, and so on, up to 50% from 91–100.

This ability is checked after the battle ends, at which point any temporary ability changes have worn off.","The Pokémon may gather
Honey from somewhere."
311,frisk,4,"When this Pokémon enters battle, it reveals an opposing Pokémon's held item to all participating trainers.

This Pokémon's held item, whether or not it is a Plate, cannot be taken by covet or thief, nor removed by knock off, nor traded by switcheroo or trick.  Covet, Thief, and Knock Off still inflict damage against this Pokémon.  Unlike with sticky hold, this Pokémon cannot use fling, Switcheroo, or Trick to lose its item itself, nor gain an item through Switcheroo or Trick if it does not have one.

This ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than arceus.  This ability cannot be traded with skill swap, nor copied with role play or trace, nor disabled with gastro acid, nor changed with worry seed.  This Pokémon cannot use Skill Swap or Role Play to lose its ability itself.  mold breaker cannot ignore this ability.

This Pokémon cannot steal upon being knocked out.  It can steal if the attacker has a substitute, but cannot steal when its own Substitute is hit.
